According to a lind of promise made in the lifteenth lium-417
her of the Classical Jomnal‚· we now-ppreae'nt our readers with
an account of ΜΓ. Hermann’osttnon of thohupplices oi Euri-
pides. lt hears ‚so =great a ¹tesssnltl'ance· to· hia edition of the
{inculca Furens, Ἡ which ’πὶ 'have ali⁸eady⁴ given an¹ account,
that we havelam to say on the present thenon the' former oc⁴
cesion, before we proceed to tlte consideration of particular
passages,— Referring to our general observatione on the' edition ’
'of the Hermathena, we have only to observa of the edi-
tion of the Supplices, rheticio, upon the whole, rather 'su-
perior in merit to its predecessor. It discovers fewer marka of
predpitafiony und lite -notes--vrhicla mompnny it, ere· sume-
what more copiotrs, frequent, and aadsfsctoryc ' ·
·It is to he repented, thassit was no‘t in ΜΓ. Hermsmr’s pus
wer to avail himself oi the notes of Person on this tragedy,
ansi of the other ralusble · additional matter contained in the
last impression of Marldand's edition, which was printed at Ox-
’ ford under the superintenddnce 'of Mr. Gaissord. Like the-edi-
tions of Aeschylus by Turnebus and Roborrenus, these two edi-
tions of the Supplices were printed in the same year‚'with0ut
any appearance, as far as we can observo , that either editor
was avara of the publication of another edition in a different
part of the world. Το point ont the new readings of any im*
por-tenca which are common to these editions, is one -of the ilun-
ties ¹which we have imposed upon ourselves in the preparation
of tho present article. - · '

Supplices, but aino the· first ond second Iphigenia, with the an-
notatione of Markland. A criticism on this volume appeared in
